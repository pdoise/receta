    "Note: he uses blue crabs that were boiled in crab boil, then cleaned and halved, leaving the legs and claw attached to the body. Also, he made enough for a restaurant ‐ this is a scaled down version for home use.

    Ingredients
    1 cup light roux
    1 lb bag mixed seasoning veggies (onion/bell pepper/celery)
    1 can Rotel at least
    1/2 gallon of water cajun seasoning to taste
    1 lb peeled deveined medium shrimp
    several boiled crabs, cleaned of top shell and gills, broken in halves

    Directions:
    In a stock pot, heat the roux over medium heat. Add the veggies and Rotel, stirring well, let smother until veggies are very soft (at least 20 minutes), stirring often to make sure the roux isn't sticking to the bottom. When the veggies are cooked down, add the water, whisking to incorporate, and bring to a boil. Let it boil gently for about 5 minutes to check consistency, adding water if it's too thick or letting it cook longer if it's too thin. When you've got it to your preferred consistency, add seasoning (salt/pepper/red pepper/garlic powder/hot sauce) to taste. Lower the heat and let it simmer for 15 minutes. Add the shrimp and crabs, let simmer until shrimp turn pink. Serve over cooked rice. Of course, it's always better served the next day. If you want to serve it with lots of flavor right out the pot, use chicken stock instead of water. Adjust the recipe to your crowd."},
